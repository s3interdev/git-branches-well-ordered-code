# Git Branches for Well Ordered Code

## Description

Proper management of git is essential to organizing your code in a reasonable way. In this project I will attempt to organize code into development and production ready main branches so that there is always a version of the code is ready to go.

Then, I show that you can work on feature branches and get everything perfect before merging to main branch using a pull request.

Also this time I use the Git features found within Visual Studio Code instead of at Git GUI tool like GitKraken as with the previous project.

## Tools

1. Visual Studio Code
1. Git
1. GitHub
