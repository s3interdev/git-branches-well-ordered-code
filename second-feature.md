# Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. **I don't know, what do you think?** _Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead._ You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

## You don't believe in the Force, do you?

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

1. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
2. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
3. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

### Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

- I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
- Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
- The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. What!? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?
